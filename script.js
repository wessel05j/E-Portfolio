    title: "Main Project",

    <h3>Block Catcher</h3>
    <p>A game I coded during High School as my final grade project.</p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The game starts with a main menu that introduces the player to the rules and objective.  
      You control a small block at the bottom of the screen, and your goal is to catch falling blocks before they hit the ground.  
      The game gets progressively faster, challenging your reflexes and reaction time.  
    </p>

    <p>
      While it may look simple, this project was where I first learned to combine coding, logic, and creativity into a fully working game.  
      I showcase it as my main project because it represents my first big milestone in programming and problem-solving.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Key Features:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Main menu with instructions</li>
        <li>Player-controlled block movement</li>
        <li>Increasing difficulty as blocks fall faster</li>
        <li>Score tracking</li>
        <li>Simple yet fun gameplay</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <h4>EV3 Mindstorm Track Project (Ongoing)</h4>
    <p>
      A robotics project where I programmed a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robot to navigate and race on a custom-built track.  
      The project focuses on <strong>autonomous navigation, sensor integration</strong> (color and ultrasonic sensors), and <strong>algorithm design</strong> for pathfinding and obstacle avoidance.  
      This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of robotics, programming logic, and iterative testing.

    </p>

    <h4>This e-Portfolio (Ongoing)</h4>
    <p>
      This very portfolio is one of my most important projects because it is designed, coded, and maintained entirely by me.  
      It is built with <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, and I keep improving it to serve as both a professional portfolio and a sandbox for experimenting with new ideas.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Key aspects include:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean & Extendable Structure:</strong> Built in a modular way, making it easy to add new projects or features.</li>
        <li><strong>Styling & Theming:</strong> Minimal yet modern look, focusing on readability and user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing Development:</strong> Currently working on adding interactive elements, improved navigation, and possibly API integrations.</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>Motivational Diary (Java Project â€“ Ongoing)</h4>
    <p>
      A personal project where I am developing a <strong>Java-based diary application</strong>.  
      The goal is to create a simple but effective tool where users (including myself) can record daily thoughts, track motivation levels, and set personal goals.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Planned features:
      <ul>
        <li>User-friendly interface for writing daily entries</li>
        <li>Search and filter by dates, moods, or tags</li>
        <li>Export functionality (text or JSON) for backups</li>
        <li>Future extension: statistics/graphs of motivation over time</li>
      </ul>
